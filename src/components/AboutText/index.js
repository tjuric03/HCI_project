      <h1> HISTORY </h1>
      <p>
        {" "}
        When he announced in Paris, on a winter's evening in 1892, the
        forthcoming re-establishment of the Olympic Games, Pierre de Coubertin
        was applauded, but nobody at the time imagined the scale of the project
        that reviving the ancient Olympic Games, appointing a committee in
        charge of organising them and creating an international movement would
        entail. The International Olympic Committee was created on 23 June 1894;
        the first Olympic Games of the modern era opened in Athens on 6 April
        1896; and the Olympic Movement has not stopped growing ever since.{" "}
      </p>
      <h1> THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE </h1>
      <p>
        The International Olympic Committee (IOC) is a not-for-profit
        independent international organisation that is committed to building a
        better world through sport. Created on 23 June 1894, just under two
        years before the first Olympic Games of the modern era in April 1896,
        the IOC is the supreme authority of the Olympic Movement.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the leader of the Olympic Movement, the IOC acts as a catalyst for
        collaboration between all parties of the Olympic family, from the NOCs,
        the IFs, the athletes and the OCOGs to the Worldwide Olympic Partners,
        broadcast partners and United Nations (UN) agencies, and shepherds
        success through a wide range of programmes and projects. On this basis,
        it ensures the regular celebration of the Olympic Games, supports all
        affiliated member organisations of the Olympic Movement and strongly
        encourages, by appropriate means, the promotion of the Olympic values.
      </p>
      <h1> THE OLYMPIC MOVEMENT </h1>
      <p>
        The three main constituents of the Olympic Movement are the
        International Olympic Committee (“IOC”), the International Sports
        Federations (“IFs”) and the National Olympic Committees (“NOCs”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to its three main constituents, the Olympic Movement also
        encompasses the Organising Committees for the Olympic Games (OCOGs), the
        national associations, clubs and persons belonging to the IFs and NOCs,
        particularly the athletes, as well as the judges, referees, coaches and
        the other sports officials and technicians. It also includes other
        organisations and institutions as recognised by the IOC.
      </p>
      <p>
        As is clearly stated in the Olympic Charter: “The goal of the Olympic
        Movement is to contribute to building a peaceful and better world by
        educating youth through sport practised in accordance with Olympism and
        its values.” (Olympic Charter, Chapter 1, Rule 1.1)
      </p>
      <h1> FUNDING </h1>
      <p>
        The International Olympic Committee is entirely privately funded and
        ever since the first modern Olympic Games in Athens in 1896 it has
        relied upon contributions from commercial partners in order to stage the
        Games and support the Olympic Movement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The IOC redistributes 90% of its revenue, meaning that every day the
        equivalent of over USD 3.4 million is distributed to support athletes
        and sports organisations at all levels around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sponsorship in various forms has supported the Olympic Movement since
        the first modern Olympic Games in Athens in 1896, while broadcast
        coverage has been the most significant factor in the promotion of the
        Olympic ideals and the growth of the Olympic Games worldwide.
